# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Engineer Nanodegree.
In this project, I built and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.

The model building was in two part, the first part I created an Azure ML pipeline using hyperdrive to choose the optimal hyperameters of a Scikit-learn logistic regression model.

The second part I configured and run an Azure AutoML model on the same dataset and the best model chosen.

The two models were compared to see which one perormed better interms of accuracy.

>*Hyperdrive: is a python package that automates the process of choosing the best hyperparameters for your machine learning model.*


## Summary
The dataset contains 32,950 observation. Each of the observation corresponds to an individual information (eg. Age, Marital Status, Education level), however, the source and the data dictionary wasn't given. 

The dataset has 20 features and one binary target variable y. We seek to predict the target variable y with the 20 features.

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

The solution to this problem is a binary classification model capable of predicting the class `yes` or `no` of the target variable `y`. The best performing model was a `Voting Ensemble` model by the Azure Auto ML run.


## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
